IDEA:

If there are three sources A B C and each source has some grade in company like A in 3rd grade, B and C in 2nd grade, each task(having credits) should be done by two sources and each source has been assigned his maximum workload based on their grade:
Grade 1:100(B,C)
Grade 3:60(A)

Let's take a task 'alpha'(work load=100)(Credits:50):
A,B can do the work together
Or
A,C can do the work together
Or
B,C can do the work together

Conditions those are not allowed:

A,B,C can't work individually.

Any two or more than two take the task then their work load credit will be shared among them basis on their grade and till the work is not submitted work load score will be retarded from the working sources.

Every task will have a deadline, and each day after deadline cost sources 1 credit each involved in the task.




STRUCTURE:

Here we will be having some entities:
--->Source:
	Attributes:
	>Job role
	>Grade
	>Maximum workload
	
---->Task:
	Attributes:
	>Task load
	>Task credit
	>Task deadline




DESIGN:
 
Each source will be having his dashboard.
Dashboard displays:
->Credit score
->Task pending
->Employee info(grade and role)
